**SpaceInvaders**

    SpaceInvaders is an iOS app built with Sprite Kit and Swift; the project was developed by first following a tutorial to create the base and then heavily modifying and building off of it to create what it is currently.

**Description**

    SpaceInvaders utilizes the hardware's accelerometer so that the user can tilt the device to move the player left and right while tapping on the screen to fire lazers in order to destroy the conveniently clustered enemies. Killing said enemies earns the player points, enough of which and the player can immortalize their name in the local high score chart. The game elements are programmatically scaled based on the screen's logical resolution width and as such should work on any iOS device. 

**Features**

    1. Accelerometer based player control.
    2. Tap-to-shoot action.
    3. Local, persistent, highscore chart.
    4. Engaging sound fx and music.
    5. Universal design, plays on any sized iOS device.
        
**Build/Run**:

	1. git clone git@gitlab.encs.vancouver.wsu.edu:t.bounds/SpaceInvaders.git
	2. Open project in Xcode.
	3. Hit the build/run button in Xcode.
        1. Make sure to build to an external device such as an iPad.
